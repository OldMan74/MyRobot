# MyRobot
This repository contains my work on developing a little robot.  
I have decided to learn GitHub and use it as a location to explain the work I have done while trying to develop a working robot.  It will include, hopefully, the problems I ran into and how I came to solve them.  I began this project Mar 1, 2017 when I ordered the first hardware from Amazon. Â My first decision: the robot will use the Raspberry Pi 3 as its main controller.  To that end I bought the following hardware from Amazon:
* CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 Complete Starter Kit - 32GB edition
* [Updated] Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo, Foxcesd Ultra Compact Wireless Whisper-Quiet Portable Keyboard & Mouse Set No Laser Light Mouse With 2-in-1 Nano Receiver for PC and Mac (Black+Delete Key)
* Sceptre E165W-1600HC E 16" Screen LED-Lit Monitor, True Black (E165W-1600HC)
